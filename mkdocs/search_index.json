Also, plugin adds color picker, color format converter to easily modify colors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n - Using \nSublime Package Control\n\n\nCtrl\n\uff0b\nShift\n\uff0b\nP\n then select \nPackage Control: Install Package\n\n\ninstall \nColor Highlighter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, download the package from \nGitHub\n into your \nPackages\n folder.\n\n\nFor gutter icons install \nImageMagick\n. To configure ImageMagick, update \nicon_factory.convert_command\n plugin setting.\n\n\n\n\nColor Highlighting styles\n\n\nThere are three color highlighting styles: inline highlighting, underline blocks, and gutter icons.\n\n\nGutter icons\n\n\nTo enable highlighting colors with gutter icons go to\n\nTools > Color Highlighter > Color Highlighters > Highlight colors in all text > Gutter icon style\n and select \nCircle\n or \nSquare\n.\nHighlighting colors with gutter icons requires ImageMagick to be installed (see the installation section).\nGoing to \nTools > Color Highlighter > Color Highlighters > Highlight colors in all text > Gutter icon style\n and selecting \nNone\n will disable it.\n\n\nThis mode can cause pauses when opening big files for the first time with \"highlihgt everything\" mode because\nthe plugin needs to create icons for all newly encountered colors.\n\n\nUnderline blocks\n\n\nHighlighting colors with underline blocks will display colored blocks right under highlighted colors.\nThese blocks cause text reflow.\nTo enable highlighting colors with underline blocks go to\n\nTools > Color Highlighter > Color Highlighters > Highlight colors in all text\n and click \nHighlight colors with blocks\n.\nClicking on this setting again will disable it.\n\n\nInline highlighting\n\n\nInline color highlighting itself has several styles.\nAll of them require Color Scheme modification, so when this mode is enabled the view's color scheme is changed to a fake one,\nwhich is a copy of the real color scheme, but augmented with the plugin-specific definitions.\nTo disable inline highlighting  go to\n\nTools > Color Highlighter > Color Highlighters > Highlight colors in all text > Inline highlighting style\n and select \nNone\n.\n\n\nInline blocks\n\n\nHighlighting colors with inline blocks will display colored blocks right on top of highlighted colors.\nTo enable highlighting colors with inline blocks go to\n\nTools > Color Highlighter > Color Highlighters > Highlight colors in all text > Inline highlighting style\n and select \nFilled\n.\n\n\nColored text\n\n\nHighlighting colors with colored text will make colors text be rendered with that color.\nTo enable highlighting colors with colored text go to\n\nTools > Color Highlighter > Color Highlighters > Highlight colors in all text > Inline highlighting style\n and select \nText\n.\n\n\nOutline and underline styles\n\n\nIf one wants color highlighting to be more subtle that one with inline blocks he can select one of\n\nOutlined\n, \nUnderlined solid\n, \nUnderlined strippled\n, \nUnderlined squiggly\n styles in\n\nTools > Color Highlighter > Color Highlighters > Highlight colors in all text > Inline highlighting style\n menu.\n\n\nColor Highlighting modes\n\n\nHighlight everything\n\n\nIn this mode the plugin parses the whole file and highlights all colors it can find.\nHighlighting style settings for that mode are in \nTools > Color Highlighter > Color Highlighters > Highlight colors in all text\n.\n\n\nThis mode can cause pauses when opening big files because the plugin needs to parse the whole file.\n\n\nHighlight selection\n\n\nIn this mode the plugin highlights colors under the cursor. It supports multiple selections as well.\nHighlighting style settings for that mode are in \nTools > Color Highlighter > Color Highlighters > Highlight colors in selected text\n.\n\n\nHighlight when hovering\n\n\nIn this mode the plugin highlights colors when one hovers over them with the mouse cursor.\nHighlighting style settings for that mode are in \nTools > Color Highlighter > Color Highlighters > Highlight colors when hovering the cursor above them\n.\n\n\nCombined\n\n\nThese three modes can be combined in any possible way.\nThe settings for all three modes are completely independent and can be configured all at once.\nFor example, the default settings are to highlight all colors with gutter icons and with colored text,\nhighlight selected colors with underline blocks and highlight colors one hovers over with inline blocks.\n\n\nColor picker\n\n\nJust put the cursor (or multiple cursors) where you want the color and and select \"Insert color with color picker\"\nin context menu (or press \nCtrl\n\uff0b\nShift\n\uff0b\nC\n).\nSelect the color in a popup color picker and it will be inserted in place of all your cursors.\nIf some of your cursors are in existing colors, these colors will be replaces with a newly selected one.\n\n\nColor converter\n\n\nJust put the cursor (or multiple cursors) on the color code and select \"Convert color to the next format\" in context menu (or press \nCtrl\n\uff0b\nShift\n\uff0b\n,\n) or \"Convert color to the previous format\" in context menu (or press \nCtrl\n\uff0b\nShift\n\uff0b\n.\n).\nThis will convert colors under cursors between different supported color formats.\n\n\nVariables highlighting\n\n\nTHIS FEATURE CURRENTLY DOESN'T WORK.\n\n\nIt was removed because it didn't work very well, was slow and buggy.\nRight now I'm in the process of searching for ways to implement it nicely, but it's not ready yet.\nI also plan to include color functions and native CSS variables into the release of this feature.\nPlease be patient.\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nThank you guys for all your support, I couldn't have done it wihout your contributions.
